        Sheila is a very talented friend of mine. There's this job she wants. And she should get it.
        She'd crush it. She'd literally make the company extra millions of dollars in her first 30
        days there.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>But she can't get anyone at the company to talk to her.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This is a problem. A massive problem. And from my months-long research into the current
        labor quagmire, it's maybe the real reason no one is getting hired.And the ironic thing is
        that it's also the easiest problem to fix.
